# PrivacyPolicy-Dogeremasterd
1. Is the Privacy Policy live?

A Privacy Policy URL is considered Live if it doesn’t return a HTTP error code or error message such as “page can not be found”, “bad gateway”, redirects to a homepage, and so on.
2. Is the link publicly available?

“Publicly available” means the user does not have to provide data prior to getting access to the developer’s privacy policy.

3. Does the linked page take you to a “privacy policy”?

The only thing that needs to be present in this page is the “Privacy Policy” term that could be in the heading OR within the text content - however we will also accept variations of it such as: Terms of Services, Terms and Conditions, Data Collection, Privacy Policy, Protection of Personal Data, Data Policy, GDPR (General Data Processing Regulation), Confidentiality Agreement, Policy of Personal Data, Data Management Policy, etc. (a title/heading is not mandatory in order to be compliant)
